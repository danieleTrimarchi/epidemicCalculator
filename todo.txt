1_done: resolved all exercises from https://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/SolveDifferentialEquations
2_done follow link: simulating HIV
3_done adapt for the other epidemic models
4_done Use the solve_ivp numpi method (Runge-Kutta 4th order)
    # https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html#scipy.integrate.solve_ivp
    #z = solve_ivp(model,t,z0)
5_done bring in Gabgo data as baseline and compare the results

6_ make a git repo out of this

7_ test the fatalities:
    f = int((infectious@t+shift)*fatRate)
        fatRate=0.02
        shift= 32 days

8_ code a Runge-Kutta integrator
